## Plan

My reasoning to solve this challange is split the solution in small blocks of deliverables.

- [x] Environment with the tooling required to speedup the development with confidence.
- [ ] Define the architecure required to achieve scalabilty and reliability.
- [ ] Specify and refine the domains necessaries to achieve the requirements.
- [ ] Build the data management layer (state, validations, error handling) without focusing in the UI
- [ ] Build the UI around the defined data layer focusing in the UX
- [ ] Polish the UI and iterate over the UX
- [ ] Reflect over what was done and what could be different
- [ ] Plan next moves
